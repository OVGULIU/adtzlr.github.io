I'm a University Assistent at Graz University of Technology at the Institute of Machine Components in the area of mechanical engineering.

### Research Information

In the area of computational engineering my research is focused on the fatigue behaviour of elastomer components. I heavily use numerical
simulations, deal with constitutive modelling in advanced material science and large strain theory for governing a realistic stress strain material behaviour. Elastomer componenents have limited fatigue lifetimes: when, where and why do they fail?
