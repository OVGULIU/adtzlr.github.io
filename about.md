### More Information

In the area of computational engineering my research is focused on the fatigue behaviour of elastomer components. Therefor I use numerical finite elements simulations with nonlinear material behaviour.

A preliminary work is the implenentation of a user material for large strain hyperelasticity in commericial FEM software package to be open for modern and state of the art micromechanic inspired constitutive models for the description of elastomers.

A valid understanding in finite strain theory is necessary for further work on evaluating fatigue indicators. With the theoretical knowledge and experimental data on test specimens at hand it's possible for me to adapt, extend or even develop material models for the given scenario.
